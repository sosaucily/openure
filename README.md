Openure
================================
Click here: http://bit.ly/4kb77v

Openure exposes the internal variables of Backbone Views on a page.
Just CMND-SHIFT-click on the view, and an interactive JS console opens in page.

For now, CMND-SHIFT-click on the same view to close.

[screenshot should go here]

The following variables are defined in the interactive terminal (and the standard chrome console as well, for now).

* view - the view you clicked
* model - the model of the view, if there is one. Same as typing view.model
* collection - the collection of the view, if there is one.  Same as typing view.collection
* options - the options passed to the view.  Same as typing view.options

Tell me if you prefer the variables in the chrome console, or in line.  We'll do this democratically.

Why
-------------------------
It's a hassle to find and drill down into your views from the console.  Just click and get crazy.
